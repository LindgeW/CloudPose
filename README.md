6DoF Object Pose Estimation with Point Cloud

Given a set of points X={x_i|i=1, 2, ..., n} on the surface of a known object in the **camera coordinate**, the aim of pose estimation is to find a transformation that transforms x_i from the object coordinates to the camera coordinates. This transformation is composed of a translation and a rotation.
